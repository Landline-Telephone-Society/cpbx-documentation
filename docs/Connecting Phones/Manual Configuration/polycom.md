# Poly/Polycom VVX series

Manually configuring a Polycom/Poly phone can be somewhat complex compared to most SIP phones. Enabling auto-answer for pages requries manually editing the phones config file. For this reason, provisioning is recommended for new users. 

We recommend configuring the phone via the web interface. It can be done on the phone itself, but is rather hard.

## Via web interface

Find the IP address of the phone, then go to https://<ip> in your browser (The phone will not allow HTTP (port 80) by default!).


 Login as admin. The default password is 456 if you are running an older frimware. (Newer frimware requries admin password to be set upon first boot.)
