# About Provisioning

Provisioning is an easy way to setup and keep your phones up to date! Many diffrent IP phones, ATAs, speakers and intercoms, doorbells, and other VoIP devices from Aastra, Algo, Advanced Network Devices, Audiocodes, Cisco, Cortelco, Cyberdata, Digium, Grandstream, Htek, Incom, Konftel, Linksys, Mitel, Mocet, Obihai, Panasonic, Phoenix, Polycom, Sangoma, Sipura, Snom, Uniden, Vtech, Xorcom, and Yealink can be provisioned!

A full list of devices supporting provisioning can be found here. Devices not supported will need to be manually configured, or we can consider adding support for them.

Phones can be provisioned over HTTP, HTTPS, TFTP, and FTP. However, HTTP and HTTPS are recommended as they work best through NAT traversal.
