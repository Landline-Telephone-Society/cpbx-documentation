# Cisco IP Communicator

Cisco IP Communicator is Cisco's softphone for Windows that emulates a Cisco 7970. If you have an SCCP extension, you can use CIPC to use your extension on your computer. CIPC can use HTTP for provisioning, meaning you don't need a router that can handle TFTP or a local TFTP SERVER to use it.

CIPC supports Windows XP/Windows Server 2003 and later. It can also be used on Unix-like systems (such as macOS and Linux) with Wine.

# Downloading
You can download CIPC from Archive.org

# Install
Once you have obtained the install exe, run it.
