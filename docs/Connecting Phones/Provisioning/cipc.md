# Cisco IP Communicator

Cisco IP Communicator is Cisco's softphone for Windows that emulates a Cisco 7970. If you have an SCCP extension, you can use CIPC to use your extension on your computer. Just like the 7970, CIPC only supports TFTP for provisioning. As such, if TFTP is not available, the phone will have limtited functionality. 

CIPC supports Windows XP/Windows Server 2003 and later. It can also be used on Unix-like systems (such as macOS and Linux) with Wine.

# Downloading
You can download CIPC from Archive.org

# Install
Once you have obtained the install exe, run it.
