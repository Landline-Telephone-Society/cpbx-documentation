# Recommended Devices

These are a list of devices/phones that we recommend getting as a first phone to join the LTS Community PBX. All phones listed here can be provisioned for easy setup (expect for softphones) and work fully with our systems.

## IP Phones

Cisco/Linksys SPA525G / SPA525G2: These phones are really popular and come with alot of features. They can be found on eBay ranging from $20-50 and possbily could be found in thrift stores. All other SPA series phones will work too (if you want a monochrome display) but are not that much cheaper then the SPA525's. Make sure when you buy a SPA phone it's not rebranded or has a sticker from a service provider.

Cisco 6800/7800/8800 with 3PCC frimware: The 6800/7800/8800 series IP phones from Cisco running 3PCC frimware behave alot like the SPA's and are easy to setup and provision. However, they can be rather expnesive. Not many service providers use these phones so it's not likely they are locked. However, they could be locked to Cisco Webex too. Also, make sure the phone has a proper 3PCC license attached to it or it will not work.

Poly VVX X50 series: These phones are a good alternative to Cisco phones if you don't like those. They look and feel alot like Cisco Enterprise phones with a mix of a little mix of 3PCC. Like the 3PCCs phones, they have a web interface. We recommend provisoing these phones though, as when not provisoned, they can be a little bit of a struggle. Many service providers use these phones, so don't get one rebranded. And make sure before you buy one they are not locked. As they can be locked with zero touch provisoing.

Polycom VVX X00, X01, X10, X11 series: These are the older verisons of the X50 series. They have an older desgin and UI, but the feature set, web interface, and functionality is almost the same. Just like the X50's these can be locked too so make sure they are not before buying one.

## ATA's

### ATA's are devices that let you use landline/analog/POTS telephones and equipment with VoIP systems.

Cisco SPA112: These ATA's can be gotten for super cheap and are know to work great and be reabile. They are super easy to setup. And can possbily be found at thrift stores.
