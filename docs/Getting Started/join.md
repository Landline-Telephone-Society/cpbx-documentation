# Join

Our goal is to make it as easy as possible for anyone to join, connnect their phone, and make their first phone call. However, for security, we must manually verify all new members.

Anyone who is at least 13 and not banned from the LTS Discord Server is allowed to join the LTS Community PBX. 

To get started, go to [Join](/join). You can either choose to fill out the join form, or to join the LTS Discord server and go to the #get-an-extension channel to get started.

At this time, we don't yet have an automated extension creation system. However, we are working on building one.
