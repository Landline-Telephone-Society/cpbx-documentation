3. Device Information
When you connect a device to the LTS Community PBX via PJSIP or CHAN_SIP, your devices brand, model, and firmware version, and in some cases, the MAC address is sent to the PBX via a user agent. When you add an SCCP device, the model number and MAC address of the device is stored on the system. Also, when you add a provisioned phone, the brand, model number, and MAC address is stored on the system. This device information is used:
- So that your phone can connect to your extension and use the correct configuration (in the case of provisioning or SCCP devices)
- For you to be able to view how your extension is used, and to ensure security of it.
- For us to view and block suspicious or illegal activity.
- For us to view how the system is being used to better improve our services.
- For anonymous popularity consents and statistics (public information on what devices are used on the system, posted without any personally identifiable information)
For devices that are not SCCP or not provisioned, the information will only be stored for as long as the device is online. As soon as you disconnect your device, the user agent info will be removed. If your device is SCCP or is provisioned, this information will be stored as long as your device is added a provisioned device, so that your device can reconnect to the system in the future. As soon as you delete your device, the information will be removed from the system.
