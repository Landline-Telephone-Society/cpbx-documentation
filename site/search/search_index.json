However, any member can enable call recordings when they wish. There are 3 preferences for call recording and every member must pick one:</p> <p>Enabled: If you are on a call with another member with call recordings set to enabled or don't care, or are making an inbound or outbound call, the call will be recorded.</p> <p>Don't care: If you are on a call with someone with call recording enabled, the call will be recorded. Otherwise, the call will not be recorded. People with call recordings set to don't care will still be able to retrive the recordings of the calls that were recorded later.</p> <p>Disabled: Your calls will not be recorded by our system. Whether or not the party on the other end have call recordings enabled.</p> <p>Please note that people can still record calls even when call recording is disabled, such as with call recording devices, phones with built-in call recording, cameras/microphones, via their PBX, etc. And everyone is expected to announce call recording per the PBX's terms of service.</p> <p>If a call on the PBX is being recorded, an announcement will play before the call is connected.
